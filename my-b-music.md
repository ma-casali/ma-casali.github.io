The following is a collection of the EPs I have released over the past couple years.

*Optimism and Enthusiasm* is my most recent release. This EP is focused primarily on songs written for and about my brother, Lucas. It opens with "At Shuteye Lookout", a song that reminisces and tries to recreate the feeling of Shuteye Lookout in the Emigrant Wilderness -- a place that I would visit with my family annually and that my brother loved immensely. It then goes into other songs that are meditative and mix field recordings with piano and synths to create a feeling of wrapped in another world. It ends with the song "Along Shoreline", which is perhaps my favorite because it attempts to capture the feeling that I imagine my brother must have felt on his many rides down to Shoreline Lake. 

# stars *2024*

*stars* was my first attempt at releasing an EP with an attempt at professional-level mastering. It is a collection of songs that I had sat on for a long time -- trying to hone -- until the point that I felt brave enough to put them out into the world. The EP is bookended by two versions of the same song "intro" and "outro", where "intro" is a clean piano piece and "outro" is a processed version, that smears the sounds in "intro" using a convolutional-smearing post-production script that I wrote in Python. Other songs in the EP focus on different tones: "costa" is reminiscent, "blue kettle" is rolling and more intense, and "a blanket" is warm and slow. This EP was an experiment and as an experiment, showed me that I loved to write music, but even more than that, I loved to write music so that I can share it with the people that I love.
