# The Idea

In order to ensure asymmetric scattering measurement capabilities in an water-filled impedance tube, I worked on the design, construction, and validation of a Willis coupling enabled transducer. 

**What is Willis Coupling?**

# The Experiment

*This is where I'll talk about the impedance tube experiment and show some cool pictures.*

# The Results

*This is where I'll talk about the results we got*
